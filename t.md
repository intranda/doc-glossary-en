## Title key \(TSL\)

The title key is made up as follows \(provided that the title contains more than four words\):  
The first four letters of the first word, the first two letters of the second word, the first two letters of the third word and the first letter of the fourth word.  
If the title contains fewer than four words, the corresponding letters are omitted. The title key is used for periodicals and series since there is no author.
