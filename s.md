# S

## Session

The time for which users remain automatically logged in, even though they may no longer be using the program. To prevent others from accessing the data and therefore avoid potential errors, the session length is limited. The default length of the session can be set by each user in the user configuration window. Once this time has expired, the user is automatically logged out.

## Shell command

An input field in which you can enter text-based commands to be executed immediately by the computer.

## Script

This is a file written in a script language, i.e. in a program code that is executed line by line and is not compiled. This means that users can perform a step within the Goobi workflow by calling an external program.

## Sort title

The title of a source work that is used for sorting purposes. It does not necessarily match the actual title of the work because it does not contain any \(in\)definite article or other special characters that might appear before the first word in the title.

## Status icon

The task list includes a column with a coloured square to indicate the current status of each task. The four status colours are green \(task completed\), yellow \(task in progress\), orange \(not yet accepted by a user\) and red \(task blocked\).

A bar with several colours is used to indicate the status of a process. The red section of the bar corresponds to tasks that have not yet been accepted. The yellow section indicates tasks that are in progress \(or waiting to be accepted\), while green is for those tasks that have already been completed.

## Structure data

The entire body of structure elements. Data in which the hierarchically recorded structure elements are stored.

## Structure element

One of a group of hierarchically organised categories that identify key elements within a source work, starting with the type of publication \(e.g. monograph\) and various sub-elements such as the foreword, chapter, introduction, afterword and glossary. Each sub-element may have its own sub-sub-elements. The idea is to reproduce the structure of the work as accurately as possible.

## Structure tree

This term is used to describe the tree-like hierarchy of structure elements.

## Sub-element

Structure elements can be divided into various sub-elements such as the foreword, content and an afterword. Each sub-element may have its own sub-sub-elements.

## Search box

Search boxes take the form of a template that allows users to enter one or more search terms. The layout is standardised, and the box appears whenever you perform a search.

## Search parameter

One or more keywords, PPN numbers or other details from the source work that can be used to perform a search.

## Symbol

Used to denote a concept, relationship, etc.
