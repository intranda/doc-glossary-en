## Author-Title-Key \(ATS\)

This key is made up of the first four letters of the author’s surname and the first two letters of the ‘sort title’ \(i.e. the title used for sorting purposes\). It is used for books with a known author, e.g. monographs. If there is no author, the Title Key is used as the key instead.
